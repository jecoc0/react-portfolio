# React Portfolio

## Description

This project was completed to showcase the coding skills that I have developed thus far, and will be updated as I learn new things. I wanted to showcase the skills that I have learned in the last six months including my personal and group projects. 
For these projects, I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, React, Firebase, and much more.
This portfolio will provide any future employers with an idea of who I am personally and the level of work I am capable of creating.
While creating this project, I learned how to translate React from old projects to make it work in a new project to showcase my current skillset.
